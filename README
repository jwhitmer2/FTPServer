So far, I have the server receiving strings from any number of clients less than
LISTENQ and sending the string back to the client that sent it. 
There are no commands currently implemented, and the server runs on an infinite
loop. The files can be compiled via the makefile.

To run the server, the user needs to enter ./server.x <port number>
To run the client, the user needs to enter ./client.x <IP address> <port number>
